			<h2>"Hey,there's something on my mind that I've been wanting to share with you. As we've spent time together, I've come to realize that my feelings for you go beyond just liking. Your laughter, the way you carry yourself, and the genuine connection we've formed have made a significant impact on me. I value our moments together, and it's only fair for me to be open about it â€“ I really like you. I understand if this is unexpected, but I felt it was important to be honest about my feelings.Do u <span>like</span> me too?</h2>
